 This applicaton is developed to help anyone who wants to connect to an xml or json api and get results in xml or json format but it can be turned into a human readable format as a csv format.
 
 so to compile and execute the above two scripts u will need any IDE that is commonly used to run java applications(either of netbeans or eclipse).
 
after the inclusion of both the files to be able to compile and execute the json files u will need also to add a jar file as a new library which is called json-java after the addition of the jar file, the execution is same as a normal java application.
 
for the execution of th xml file nothing more is needed rather a simple execution of a simple java application
